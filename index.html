        <h2>Every idea <img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="">starts with a need </h2>
        <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract
            more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored
            on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought.
            I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but
            the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
